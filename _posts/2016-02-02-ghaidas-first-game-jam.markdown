### What's a game jam?
A game jam is when a group of people make games in a limited amount of time. The biggest such event is the [Global Game Jam.](http://globalgamejam.org/) This is a global event, with different locations providing spaces for people to make games together.

### Cool! Except, it didn't go so well
I didn't go in with a team. That was my first mistake. I'm mostly introverted, with brief bouts of enthused extraversion when I'm excited. I tried to get myself into the latter mood going into the game jam, but my enthusiasm was deflated the minute I stepped foot inside the venue; there were literally only 7 women there compared to maybe 40 men.

I was disheartened to say the least, but I didn't want the ratio to influence my experience. I tried as much as possible to get out of my comfort zone. I met two people at the jam who seemed nice and we set out on making an abstract "experience", similar to [Kyoto.](http://illogictree.com/games/kyoto/)

### Day 1
With a 48-hour deadline, I knew that feature-creep was going to be a problem, so we started thinking about honing down on a singular mechanic, it didn't have to be a "game" mechanic per se, as in it didn't have to have a goal or advance the player, it just needed to be **fun**, **discoverable**, and easily **repeatable**.

### Day 2
Day 2 started with us knowing what we needed to do. That's when feature-creep started, and that's when I made the second mistake. I should have voiced my concerns that we were attempting to do too much, but I remained quiet, because I was afraid of being perceived as a downer by my teammates.

I played myself.

### Day 3
Suffice it to say that by day 3 I knew that I wasn't going to make the kind of game I would like to play. I pushed through because I wanted to finish what I started. I don't regret doing the jam. I think I learned a lot and learned not to beat myself up for what I don't know. I did learn that, during the next game jam, I should take the time at the beginning to find the right team for me.

### Major :key:
I have to keep reminding myself, that the reason I'm doing this is because I love video games, and because I _know_ what makes games great. I also know that I'm not going to just make great games overnight, and that [I shouldn't quit because I don't like what I'm making right now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loxJ3FtCJJA) That would be the ultimate self-play.

### What I learned
* Team matchmaking based on skills is a terrible idea
* Instead, I should find people who are excited about my idea, or whose idea I'm excited about
* The ratio of men to women is worse in the games industry than the general tech industry
* Game jams are just like hackathons, and I never liked hackathons
* Not to fucking ignore project management, _especially_ with a 48-hour deadline
* How to better manipulate particle systems in Unity
* Garageband is amazing for quick and dirty sound effects
* Speak the fuck up.
