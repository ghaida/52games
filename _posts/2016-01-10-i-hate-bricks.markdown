### Why I made this
Breakout, and variations of it, was one of my favorite games growing up. It's also one of the simplest games I could make. At least that's what I thought. It's a seemingly simple game, yet there's so much to consider when making it. The initial mechanics didn't take much to code up; tweaking with settings took up the majority of my time.

I also learned all about [prefabs](http://docs.unity3d.com/410/Documentation/Manual/Prefabs.html) and my mind exploded. The workflow for making a 2D game in Unity is starting to make sense now:

1. Make sprites
2. Drop them into Unity
3. Turn Sprite to prefab
4. Add script to control behavior
5. Repeat

There are other details for sure, but that seems to be the gist of it so far. It's pretty neat.

Why do I hate bricks? I don't know, I just know I hate them enough to hurtle through space destroying spacebricks with my a pink ball. Early game developers didn't have to explain and neither do I.

TL;DR It was the next game in the Unity tutorial I'm following.

### What I learned
* Really simple games have some pretty complex loops
* Level design is really time-consuming
* Prefabs are _awesome._

### WTF
* Particle systems
* ... can be used to make rad backgrounds

P.S. One day these posts will be in-depth. Now I'm too busy learning shit.
