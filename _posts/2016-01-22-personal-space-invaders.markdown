## Or... غزو التماسيح

### Why I made this
I started making a space invaders clone. I even made a few spaceship and enemy sprites, but I decided to make things a bit more interesting.

I was born and raised in [Jeddah, Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah). It wasn't a bad place to grow up in but it certainly had–and has–its fair share of problems, especially for women. There are a lot of problems women in Saudi Arabia deal with not the least of which is [harassment](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/08/07/sexual-harassment-saudi-arabia_n_7934850.html). Harassment of women takes many forms, and one of the most prevalent forms when I was a teenager was "targeem."

Targeem is when men attempt to pick up women by driving alongside the woman's car and yelling at her to lower her window so the man can toss a crumpled up piece of paper through it. This happened in my high school too, boys would clamor outside the schoolyard's high wall and toss phone numbers over the wall. They don't know what the girls look like or who might be calling them later, but I guess it gave them _hope_.

When I was a teenager, I'm not gonna lie, it was _exciting_ to get in a car with my friends and drive around the trendy area of the city signaling to teenage boys in their car to toss their phone numbers to us. As I grew older and learned better ways of getting introduced to potential love interests, targeem became a nuisance. I also quickly learned that men can't really handle rejection, and my refusal to accept someone's number has put me in a dangerous situation more times than I care to recount.

Kids these days apparently hold up iPads against the car window displaying their phone numbers in big bold numbers. Millennials are _chill_.

So I made a game about an annoying aspect of being a woman in Saudi, dodging randos throwing pieces of paper at me while I'm minding my own business.

The game is pretty simple. You can move left and right. Avoid the numbers being thrown at you, and press [spacebar] to just say no to randos.

### What I learned
* The layers matrix in Unity, and tweaking collision detection between different layers
* Level design is really time-consuming
* Making a game you can never win is depressing
* Unless it's [Neko Atsume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neko_Atsume)
