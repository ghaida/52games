description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  I'm challenging myself to make 52 games in 2016; one game every week.
  Every week I'm going to post a link to the game and documentation of
  process and what I've learned.
baseurl: "/52games" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://ghaida.github.io/52games" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
