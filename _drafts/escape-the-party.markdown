### OMFG Train Jam
I had been wanting to do this jam since I heard about it from [a friend](http://indiesaudi.com) a couple of years ago.

### Day 1

### Day 2

### Day 3

### Major :key:
I have to keep reminding myself, that the reason I'm doing this is because I love video games, and because I _know_ what makes games great. I also know that I'm not going to just make great games overnight, and that [I shouldn't quit because I don't like what I'm making right now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loxJ3FtCJJA) That would be the ultimate self-play.

### What I learned
*

### Okay, wasn't I supposed to make one game a week?
Yeah, I've been slacking off. A lot has happened in the past month, mainly an awesome new job at a little video streaming service you might have invited someone over to enjoy while you chill.
