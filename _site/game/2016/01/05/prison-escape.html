    <h4 id="why-i-made-this">Why I made this</h4>
<p>This isn’t my first game, but it is my first game using Unity. I signed up for a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse">Unity course</a> on Udemy and went to town. I’ve only ever played a few text adventure games, so it was pretty challenging to think about how to describe the world in words rather than draw it out.</p>

<p>Although this game is super short and pretty limited, it was still challenging to make sure I closed all loops and also remained aware of the player’s current state. The tutorial doesn’t really cover this much because it was focused on just getting the students through the game. After testing it out a couple of times I was pretty bothered by the fact that the game wasn’t aware when you picked up an item. This meant that unless the player goes through a very specific sequence of events, they’d have to start over from the beginning.</p>

<p>The challenge should be in figuring out the puzzle, not fiddling with the program’s controls.</p>

<h4 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Making games is hard</li>
  <li>Making games is fun</li>
  <li>If there’s a broken loop somewhere, your players will discover it on the first playtest</li>
  <li>… so just fix it if you know it’s there.</li>
</ul>

<p>I always thought Unity was pretty intimidating. I became much more comfortable with it after finally just <em>sitting down and making a game already.</em></p>
